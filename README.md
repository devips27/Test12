Challenges faced:
I had faced some issues while implementing Spring Security. I had missed to include <security:authorize  access="hasAnyRole('ROLE_ADMIN')"> in the jsp page
I had some problems while inserting image in the Product table.I had to use LOAD_FILE('C:\\devips\\cherry.jpg')
I had some difficulties implementing the Java Mail API. I had include two JAR files for JAVA mail API.
